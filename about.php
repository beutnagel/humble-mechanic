    <h1 class="container__title">About me</h1><img class="container__img" src="images/him.jpg" alt="The Boss"/>
    <p class="container__p">I have been working as a Volkswagen technician, mechanic, grease monkey, well you get the idea.  I started this site mainly to connect with my customers on a level  that I just can’t in the shop.<br><br>

You will find out what it takes to be a mechanic in a VERY high tech industry.<br><br>

This site will give everyone a place to connect with me, and connect with each other.<br><br>

There has been so crazy things that have happened over the years, and I am sure you will get a kick out of it.<br><br>

This site was built to help everyone. It does not matter what type of car you own. Many of the things I talk about do not apply to just Volkswagens.<br><br>

Also, please understand that everything I talk about here comes from me. It does not represent my employer, or Volkswagen of America. Anything that I say or do is my own.</p>
<h2 class="container__title">Some other things you need to know:</h2> 
    
<ul class="container__ul">
<li class="container__li">I am not a writer. I spell stuff wrong, I write the same way I talk. I use wrong punctuation and tenses. I don’t care, Do not grammar Nazi me. Pay attention to the message</li>
<li class="container__li">I use the term “GUYS” a lot. It does not mean men, it means the same thing as “folks”, “Y’all” that kind of thing. Please don’t worry about it.</li>
<li class="container__li">I also use the word technician. To me, it means the same thing as mechanic. The title of a job is MEANINGLESS! Its the actions you take, and the integrity you work with that makes you great, or makes you SUCK!</li>
